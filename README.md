# _"What is a computer program?"_
# _"What are programmers?"_

### lets try to answer this question a 4-5-6-7-8 times!




















an abstract common answer..
#### >> "input -> something -> output"
1) a user does/clicks/touches/says something
2) computer program does something
3) the "output" is some result that benefits people





**challenge!** can you think of an input from a computer program?
typing a search in 
moving phone ( accelerometer )
camera input ( looking at barcode or a face )
checkbox
keyboard 
mouse
"hey siri"

**challenge!** can you think of an output from a computer program?
printing out paper 
email program shows you an email 
video / music can play

**challenge!** can you think of a compute program that has no output?

**challenge!** can you think of a compute program that is not for people, or for benefitting people?












what about 
### >> files
is a file a program? are all files programs?
computer programmers normally use text files to write instructions 
javascript file is a program

computer program can "compute" and sometimes give a different output

js
output / value / data
/pdf/mp4/mp3/html/gif

i would say the *program* that *reads* the PDF , or *plays* the MP4 video is the program.
because the MP4 can never change, the PDF can never change. 
but the video playing *program* can have a ***different output*** for each ***different input***.
















### >> telling the computer to do something
computer programs are **instructions** for computers
like a calculator which for the 3 inputs:
#### 1
#### +
#### 1
it gives an output of ***2***












why do we tell computers to do things? 
### >> solve human problems 

doing math calculations - can calculate your taxes!
automate repetitive tasks - automate a tractor to harvest a field

simulating things -> computer games / research  https://beautiful-crepe-5916c4.netlify.app/
remembering lots of information -> databases
organising information -> wikipedia, a to-do list
visualising information -> the web
doing lots of calculations very fast -> CPU / GPU
write a program to control a printer, that prints millions of books

computer programs are like an extension of human ability.
and they're really fast. and precise.









We could try to answer the question by rephrasing it..
### >> "What can you make with programming?"
apps, games, robots, art, management systems. 
simulate things (simulate the weather, studying virology, studying social phenomena)
make an AI
generate random numbers




























- [x] finish talking about data 



We could think about the question in terms of..
### >> "data"
Data is used to represent things the real physical world, like a _person_, _phone numbers_ or a _building_.. and also to represent 
abstract information like _open times_ or _ratings_.

Most apps show us data.
Calendars show us event data.
Bank website shows us transaction data.
to-do list show us things we have to do. 

It's hard to think of a computer program which doesn't involve data.. or representing that data

calendar saves data 
it shows you data on the screen

















Thinking  in terms of.. 
### >> LISTS
**challenge!** find an app on your phone which does not represent a list of data
( show the difference between a todo list and a calendar )

App development is kinda easy ðŸ¤· we just make lists

_stop here for today? :D_





state 
"stateful"
current way that something is 
"current data inside something"


thinking in terms of..
### >> CHANGE ("state")
tracking the weather, the economy, employees
adding an item to a shopping list.
accepting a friend invitation.

**challenge!** find an app on your phone that you can't change, or never changes.
an "app" that never has no variability sounds more like a document 













thinking in terms of 
### >> MVC model-view-controller
computer programs, especially *user interfaces* are often broken into these  logical components 
##### Model 
Model means *data*.
the database / storage (eg. my to do list items)
##### View
user can *view* the data from the model 
##### Controller
code that "DOES" stuff when there are inputs eg. user click on the view, clicks a button

thinking in terms of..
### >> CRUD
Creating or Reading or Updating or Deleting data. 
This is what programs do. programs perform operations on lists of data.

##### Create
	add or "create" some new data
##### Read
	read, show or visualise some new data
##### Update
	change the existing data
##### Delete
	delete the existing data












anyway..... 
## so a program is a file that contains bytecode that be directly fed to the CPU or a file that contains an interpreted language that can then be run by an "interpreter" like the python interpreter or a javascript interpreter eg. deno, node, bun, chrome
